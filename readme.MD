New York taxis - examining the data to reduce costs and improve services.

Description: This project exmaines New York taxi trip data over the course of several years.

Questions:

1. Can we predict the total amount for a given taxi trip based on features like Trip_distance, PULocationID, DOLocationID, tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime, RateCodeID?

2. Can we predict the tip amount a driver will receive based on the total fare, time of day, pickup and dropoff locations, and payment type?

3. Based on historical data, can we identify patterns that suggest when a driver might stop working (churn) with a particular TPEP provider (VendorID)? 
   For example, are drivers more likely to churn after a series of low tip rides, disputes, or trips to certain locations??

4. Anomaly Detection: Can we identify anomalous trips that might suggest fraudulent activity, like unusually high fares for short distances, or trips with no charge but high tip amounts?

5.
